=== Authentication on Foursquare with OAuth2

Documentation on the Foursquare API:
https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/

The purpose of the authentication is to obtain the access token. This
access token is needed when making requests (invoking operations) on
the Foursquare API.


Preparation

A "CLIENT_ID" needs to be obtained from Foursquare. Just go to and
register the dev environment application.

Client ID    : YWDNHROEVRQYDVY0QMFEBANSS43AMHPALDB3Z31HRX3KLAP3
Callback url : http://localhost/friendnav/fnav/index.html

This Client ID is actually used by Foursquare as a unique identifier
of our application.


Obtaining the access token

https://foursquare.com/oauth2/authenticate
?client_id=YWDNHROEVRQYDVY0QMFEBANSS43AMHPALDB3Z31HRX3KLAP3
&response_type=token
&redirect_uri=http:%2f%2flocalhost%2ffriendnav%2ffnav%2findex.html

If the user accepts the browser will get redirected to
http://localhost/friendnav/fnav/index.html#access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN

If the user does not accept the browser will ge redirected to
http://localhost/friendnav/fnav/index.html (*** we need to confirm
this ***).


When the application starts one of the following scenarios will occur:

* The URL has no "access_token" hash and the user has not logged in -
  The pre-login page is displayed.

* The URL has no "access_token" hash and the user has already logged
  in - The post-login page is displayed.

* The URL has the "access_token" hash and it does not matter if the
  user has already logged in - The access token is stored for later
  use when invoking Foursquare web services. The post-login page is
  displayed. The URL on the browser should also be changed to not
  contain the hash.
