= FriendNav GUI





This document describes the GUI of the FriendNav application. This
application is intended for navigating the network of nodes (friends)
in a social network.

There are two main panels in the application:

* Friend list panel - Shows the neighbour nodes of the currently
  selected node.

* Friend map panel - Shows in a map the predecessors of the current
  node, the current node, the neighbours of the current node.





== Friend list panel

Shows the following information:

* Details of the currently selected node. When the aplication starts,
  the first selected node is the user herself.

* List of neighbours of the current node.

Available actions:

* Select item on the list of neighbours. The selected item becomes the
  currently selected node.

* Back - The current node is set to the previous current node. That
  is, the predecessor of the current node becomes the current node.





== Friend map panel

Shows a map with two sets of markers.

* The predecessors of the current node and the current node. These
  markers are connected with a line, starting on the initial node and
  ending on the current node.

* The neighbours of the current node. Each of these markers is
  connected with a line to the marker for the current node.

Each marker is displayed as an icon with the image of the
corresponding node

Available actions:

* Select marker on map. The node corresponding to the marker becomes
  the currently selected node.
